You may use as you wish, credit me if you do so.

You can even use it commercially, but I'd recommend fixing the textures before hand :P

The rar contains the texture files, you should be able to get the render by hitting F12, but this will depend on the scene and version you are using.
Minor Post processing was done in photoshop.

You will need to fix the seams, and distortion on the plastic. 

This was planned for a 3d world tutorial, but as I have since looked over this, I feel I can do a lot better, and will spend more than a few minutes on the next one ;)

Concrete texture can be obtained from CGTextures
