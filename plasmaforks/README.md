This is based on several JS libraries/engines, most prominently:

* Dark Corners - http://tapio.github.com/darkcorners/
	* Game engine, the glue that ties everything together
	* It's actually a medieval game prototype, but only the core engine was used for this
		- Setting/theme changed
		- All assets replaced
		- Gameplay changed (e.g. shooting instead of running away)
		- Sounds, weapons, collectables added, among other things
* Three.js - http://mrdoob.github.com/three.js/
	* Graphics engine
* Physijs - http://chandlerprall.github.com/Physijs/
	* Physics engine
* Fireworks.js - http://jeromeetienne.github.com/fireworks.js/
	* Particle engine
* PathFinding.js - https://github.com/qiao/PathFinding.js
	* Path finding library
* dat.GUI - http://code.google.com/p/dat-gui/

With art assets, Blendswap (http://www.blendswap.com/) and especially
Open Game Art (http://opengameart.org/) have been invaluable.
